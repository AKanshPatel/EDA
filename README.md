# EDA
I have conducted EDA on two datasets: the Zomato dataset and the Titanic dataset. The Zomato dataset comprises information about various restaurants, such as their locations, cuisines, ratings, and costs, which can be used to gain insights into the restaurant industry. The Titanic dataset contains details about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics, ticket class, and survival status. EDA on this dataset can provide insights into factors affecting survival rates and help understand the demographics of the passengers.

By sharing the EDA findings and code on GitHub, I aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets, showcasing the steps taken to analyze and visualize the data. This will enable others to understand the data better, reproduce the analysis, and build upon the insights gained. The EDA code and results on GitHub serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring and understanding the Zomato and Titanic datasets.
